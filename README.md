# LLM-Helpers

LLM Helpers are essential tools, scripts, and programs designed to simplify the development, maintenance, training, and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). They assist with tasks like data preparation, model training, fine-tuning, and hyperparameter optimization, while also offering solutions for efficient inference, scalability, and API integration. These tools help manage model versions, monitor performance, and ensure robustness through evaluation, benchmarking, and adversarial testing. Additionally, LLM Helpers support data privacy, user interaction, and cost management, making it easier to build, deploy, and maintain powerful language models in real-world applications.

Hereâ€™s a simpler explanation of how to use the `describe_movie.sh` script:

## describe_movie.sh

### **What the Script Does**
The script takes a directory name, treats it as a potential movie title, and asks an AI to describe it as if it were a movie. The AI's response (description) is saved as a text file inside the directory.

---

### **How to Use It**
1. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the script to a file named `describe_movie.sh`.

2. **Make It Executable**:
   - Run this command to make the script executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x describe_movie.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Run the script and provide the directory you want to analyze as an argument:
     ```bash
     describe_movie.sh /path/to/your/directory
     ```

---

### **Example**
If you have a directory named `/home/user/movies/Inception`, run:
```bash
./describe_movie.sh /home/user/movies/Inception
```

This will:
1. Treat `Inception` as a movie title.
2. Ask the AI to describe it (plot, genre, actors, etc.).
3. Save the description in a file named `Inception-description.txt` inside the `/home/user/movies/Inception` directory.

---

### **Output**
After running the script, youâ€™ll find a new file in the directory, e.g.:
```
/home/user/movies/Inception/Inception-description.txt
```
This file will contain the AI's description of the "movie."

---

### **Requirements**
- The script assumes you have a local AI model running at `http://<your-ip>:8080/v1/chat/completions`.
- You need `curl` and `jq` installed on your system.
